### NumPy Introduction
Is a Python library for numerical computing that provides support for arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions. It is widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning due to its efficiency and convenience. NumPy's main feature is the ndarray (N-dimensional array) object, which allows for fast and efficient manipulation of large datasets. It also provides functions for linear algebra, random number generation, Fourier transforms, and more.

### Python NumPy Tutorial
 Is a beginner-friendly guide provided by the official NumPy documentation. It covers the basics of NumPy, including how to create arrays, perform basic operations, access elements, and manipulate arrays using indexing and slicing. The tutorial also introduces advanced topics such as broadcasting, array manipulation, and universal functions (ufuncs), providing readers with a comprehensive understanding of NumPy's capabilities.

### Matplotlib
 Is a Python library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations. It provides a wide range of plotting functions and customization options for creating publication-quality plots and charts. Matplotlib is widely used in scientific computing, data analysis, and data visualization due to its flexibility and ease of use. It supports various plot types, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, and more, making it a versatile tool for visualizing data in Python.
