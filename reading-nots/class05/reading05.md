### Data structures

Data structures are fundamental for efficient data organization and manipulation in computer memory. They come in various types, including linear structures like arrays and linked lists, and non-linear structures like trees and graphs. Understanding these structures is key to designing optimized algorithms and enhancing software performance. Each data structure serves unique purposes based on problem requirements, facilitating operations such as insertion, deletion, and retrieval of data. They are widely used across various applications like database management, operating systems, and artificial intelligence, enabling efficient data management and abstraction while optimizing algorithmic efficiency.

### Linked List

Linked lists are fundamental linear data structures where elements are linked using pointers, rather than stored in contiguous memory locations like arrays. Each node in a linked list contains data and a pointer to the next node. Linked lists offer advantages such as dynamic size allocation, efficient insertion/deletion operations, and flexibility in reorganization. They come in different types, including singly linked lists (traversed in one direction), doubly linked lists (allowing traversal in both directions), and circular linked lists (with the last node pointing back to the first). Operations on linked lists include insertion, deletion, and searching, with time complexity of O(n). While linked lists provide dynamic memory allocation and efficient operations, they lack direct access to elements by index and require additional memory for pointers compared to arrays. Understanding linked lists is crucial for programming and computer science, allowing for practical implementation and problem-solving using data structures.
