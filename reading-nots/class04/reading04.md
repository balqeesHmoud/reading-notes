### Python File Operations Overview

In Python, file operations involve:

1. **Opening Files:** Use `open()` to access a file for reading or writing.
   ```python
   file = open("filename.txt", "r")  # Open for reading
   file = open("filename.txt", "w")  # Open for writing
   ```

2. **Reading Files:** Use `read()` to retrieve file contents.
   ```python
   file = open("filename.txt", "r")
   content = file.read()
   ```

3. **Writing to Files:** Use `write()` to add content to a file.
   ```python
   file = open("output.txt", "w")
   file.write("Hello, world!\n")
   ```

4. **Closing Files:** Use `close()` to release file resources.
   ```python
   file = open("filename.txt", "r")
   content = file.read()
   file.close()
   ```

5. **Using `with` Statement:** Ensures proper file closure using context management.
   ```python
   with open("filename.txt", "r") as file:
       content = file.read()
   ```

These operations enable reading, writing, and managing files in Python efficiently. Always close files to free up system resources.

### Python Exception Handling

Exceptions in Python can cause abnormal termination of a program, so it's crucial to handle them effectively using `try...except` blocks.

### `try...except` Block

The `try...except` block is used to handle exceptions in Python. Here's the syntax:

```python
try:
    # code that may cause exception
except:
    # code to run when exception occurs
